# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
