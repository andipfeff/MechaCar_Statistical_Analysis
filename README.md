1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? (has significant impact on MPG)
  - Vehicle Length
  - Ground Clearance

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  - No, because our p-value is much smaller than .05%

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  - Yes because the r-value is .71, which indicates a strong positive correlation between our variables and MPG
