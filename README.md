## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
#### **Summary Statistics:**

#### **Results:**

1. The Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance, and Intercept variables/coefficients all provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.

2. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value of 5.35e-11 is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%.

3. This linear model will effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the r-value of .71 indicates a strong positive correlation between the variables and the MPG.
